# Formula One – Race Performance Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction

This project analyzes Formula 1 race performance in the 2023–2024 seasons to
understand which factors most strongly drive successful race outcomes. We link
qualifying, race results, pit stop strategies, and lap-by-lap timing data to:

- Quantify how much **grid position** matters for the final result.
- Identify **teams that consistently outperform their grid position**.
- Analyze how **pit stop strategy and lap consistency** affect podium finishes.
- Build a simple **classification model** that predicts the probability that a
  car finishes on the **podium (P1–P3)**.

The goal is to build a reproducible analytics pipeline with clean code, tests,
and clear documentation in line with DSCI 510-style final project requirements.
